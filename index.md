## About me

Vivek Singh is a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematics, University of Plymouth. He teaches AI-related courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Before joining the University of Plymouth, he contributed to the development of AI-based virtual advertisement solutions for live broadcasts at Supponor as a Computer Vision Researcher. He also worked as a Research Fellow at the Visual Artificial Intelligence Lab of Oxford Brookes University prior to that. His PhD in Computer Vision focused on human facial expression analysis and model architecture optimization.

His research tackles critical challenges at the frontier of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, with applications in medical imaging, scene understanding, video analysis, and more.

## Research Themes

The key themes of Vivek's research include:
- Extracting meaningful features from unlabelled images and videos by using the structural properties of visual scenes and integrating multiple modalities.
- Analyzing surgical actions in endoscopic videos for automated surgical assistance during medical interventions.
- Conducting medical image analysis for tasks such as tumor detection and image enhancement across various modalities, such as MRI and CT scans.
- Enhancement and manipulation of image and video quality through generative learning and super-resolution techniques.
